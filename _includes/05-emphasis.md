In my time as *Portfolio Lead*, I have gained new skills in **PowerBI and DAX, Product Ownership, and the importance of KPI tracking** throughout the year. Over the summer, I had my first managerial experience. The lessons I learned were:

1. Give **clear and measurable** deliverables right away
2. Check in with your team **frequently**
3. **Protect the team** from getting looped into "time wasters"
