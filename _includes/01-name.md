# Hello!
This page will demonstrate how I (@jonfle) have expanded my Markdown skills through a GitHub training.

## Background
During my undergrad, I used Markdown in a series of Mechanical Engineering courses. You can see one of my published documents [here](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/mems411/121). My team (Group N! Woo!) constructed a testing apparatus for brewers at AB to test different valve designs. Our goal was to design a valve that could **account for particulates** without causing significant product loss.
