# Hello!
This page is a brief introduction to me (@jonfle) and will serve as a space for me to practice my Markdown skills over time.

## Background
During my undergrad, I used Markdown in a series of Mechanical Engineering courses. You can see one of my published documents [here](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/mems411/121). My team (Group N! Woo!) constructed a testing apparatus for brewers at AB to test different valve designs. Our goal was to design a valve that could **account for particulates** without causing significant product loss.
